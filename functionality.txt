Objective:

Your goal is to build a Node.js-based system that generates an invoice in PDF format. This invoice will be styled and include dynamic data. The approach involves creating a styled HTML template using EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating), injecting dynamic values into it, and finally converting it into a PDF using Puppeteer.

Technologies to use:
• Backend: Node.js
• Templating Engine: EJS
• PDF Generator: Puppeteer
• Styling: HTML + CSS
