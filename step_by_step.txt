Great! Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** of the entire process **without any code**, just the logic you should follow to achieve your goal:

---

### **1. Set Up Your Project**

* Create a new project folder.
* Initialize it as a Node.js project.
* Install required dependencies: Express (server), EJS (templating), Puppeteer (PDF generation).

---

### **2. Prepare Folder Structure**

* Create folders for:

  * `views/` – to store your EJS templates.
  * `public/` – to hold your CSS files.
  * `output/` – where the generated PDFs will be saved (optional).

---

### **3. Create an EJS Template for the Invoice**

* Design a basic HTML invoice layout using HTML and CSS.
* Use EJS syntax to insert placeholders where dynamic data (like name, price, items) will be injected.

---

### **4. Set Up Express Server**

* Set up a basic server using Express.
* Configure it to use EJS as the view engine.
* Add a route that receives invoice data and renders the EJS template with that data.

---

### **5. Generate the HTML from EJS**

* Within the route, use the EJS engine to render your invoice template into a complete HTML string with real data.

---

### **6. Convert Rendered HTML to PDF**

* Use Puppeteer to launch a headless browser.
* Pass the rendered HTML string to Puppeteer.
* Instruct Puppeteer to generate a PDF from the HTML.
* Save the PDF to the desired location or send it as a response.

---

### **7. Test the Flow**

* Run the server.
* Trigger the invoice generation with sample data.
* Check if the generated PDF matches the design and has the correct data.

---

### **8. Polish and Improve**

* Add error handling (e.g., missing data, failed PDF generation).
* Add support for different invoice formats if needed.
* Optionally provide a download link or email the PDF.
